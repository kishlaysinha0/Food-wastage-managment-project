        <div class="secondparastart">Understanding food wastage</div>
        <div class="secondparu">Food wastage is a critical global issue that stems from the inefficient use and disposal of edible items in the food supply chain. Understanding the intricacies of food wastage involves exploring its occurrence, root causes, and the various stages where it manifests.Food wastage, often referred to as food waste, encompasses the discarding or loss of food along the entire supply chain, from production and processing to distribution, consumption, and disposal.</div>
        <div class="secondparuhai">Food wastage is a complex issue influenced by a variety of factors, both in <u>India and globally.</u> Understanding the main reasons for food wastage involves exploring the different stages of the food supply chain and the unique challenges faced by each region. Here are detailed explanations for the main reasons for food wastage in India and globally:</div>
        <div class="secondhihai"><p class="hfirstp">Reasons for Food Wastage globally:</p>
            <p class="secondp">1.Overproduction and Overconsumption.</p>
            <p class="thridp">Global Perspective In some regions, there is a tendency to overproduce food to meet anticipated demand, leading to surplus that often goes unused.Consumer Culture Overconsumption, driven by consumer habits and preferences, contributes to food waste as large quantities are purchased but not fully utilized.</p>
            <p class="hsecondp">2. Supply Chain Inefficiencies:</p>
            <p class="fivthp">Inefficient transportation and storage practices can result in spoilage and deterioration of food items before reaching consumers.</p>
            <P class="hthirdp">3. Quality Standards and Aesthetic Preferences:</P>
            <p class="fivthp">Stringent quality standards and aesthetic preferences lead to the rejection of perfectly edible produce based on appearance, contributing to unnecessary waste.</p>
            <p class="hfourthp">4.Lack of Infrastructure:</p>
            <p class="sixthp">Inadequate infrastructure in some developing countries hampers efficient storage and transportation, resulting in substantial food losses.</p></div>
        <div class="main2">
            <P class="hefirst">Reasons for food wastage in India:</P>
            <p class="paraone">Around <u>74 million</u> tonnes of food is lost in India every year, which is 22% of foodgrain output or 10% of total foodgrain and horticulture production, put together, in the country in 2022-23. The loss accounts for roughly 8% of the total 931 million tonnes of food waste globally.
                Figures on food waste were shared here during the ongoing International Workshop on Food Loss and Waste Prevention in the South Asian Region.</p>

        <p class="lol">Scientists from Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) shared the country’s food loss data, noting that the post-harvestlosses and food waste varies among geographies in the world. They said it largely depends on the crops and commodities, duration of storage, climate, technological interventions, human behaviour and traditions.
            The global data from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Food Waste Index Report 2021 shows that most of this waste globally comes from households followed by food services and retail outlets.
            The report noted that 121 kg of consumer level food is wasted each year on a global per capita level with 74 kg of this happening in households. India, on the other hand, reported a waste of 50 kg of food per person per year at the household level which is the lowest in south Asia.
            Sharing key findings from the index on the opening day of the workshop on Monday, Clementine O’Connor of UNEP said that almost 28% of agricultural land
            is used to produce the food which is never eaten or wasted.
            The three-day workshop is being organised jointly by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Thünen Institute, Germany. Over 100 delegates from Bangladesh, Bhutan, France, Germany, Indonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka are participating in it.
            Addressing the gathering at the inaugural day of the workshop, ICAR chief Himanshu Pathak pointed out that inadequate storage facilities is one of the key reasons behind food losses.
            Flagging the huge loss, he stressed that focus should shift from increasing production to protecting the produced food as the waste is not only causing economic loss but also impacting individual health and climate.
            It was shared at the workshop that India’s post-harvest quantitative food loss studies were conducted with pan India coverage through personal inquiry and actual field observations. The data was recorded using uniform data structures developed specifically for cereals, root & tubers, oilseeds & pulses, fruits & vegetables, meat, fish & seafood, and milk & egg.

            <img src="https://u4d2z7k9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Untitled-design-2022-01-14T173716.460.jpg.webp" alt="decription" style="width: 500px;" style="padding-top:20px;" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px #888;">
        </div>
            <p class="joy">Tossing away uneaten food may appear like meagre damage to the planet when compared to other issues, but the haunting reality is that it is just as harmful. 
               When we throw away food, we also throw away the precious resources that went into producing this food. This includes the use of land and natural resources, the social cost to the environment, and our biodiversity. Food waste accounts for one-third of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and generates 8% of greenhouse gases annually. With these statistics in place, there is a huge need to reduce this environmental footprint. </p>
            <p class="jio">1. WASTE OF NATURAL RESOURCES</p>
            <P class="kio">There are a number of ways in which food waste can affect the environment. When we waste food, we waste the natural resources used for producing that food, the three main ones being energy, fuel and water. 
            Water is needed for all stages of the food production process, as well as in all types of food produced. Agriculture accounts for 70% of the water used throughout the world. This includes the irrigation and spraying required for crops, and the water needed for rearing cattle, poultry and fish. By wasting food, we are wasting fresh water. Given that countries have a severe water shortage, with countries being predicted to be uninhabitable in a few decades, conserving freshwater should be a global mission. </P>
            <p class="dio">2. Contribution to Climate Change </p>
            <p class="mio">When food is left to rot in our landfills, it subsequently releases methane, a powerful greenhouse gas twenty-five times stronger than carbon dioxide. When methane is released, it lingers for 12 years and traps heat from the sun. 
                It contributes towards 20% of the global greenhouse gas emissions released. When we factor in the greenhouse gas emissions released from the use of natural resources, the contribution to climate change is astonishing. If a decent food waste treatment system were implemented, it would stop 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  
                Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research found that a third of all human-contributed greenhouse gas emissions are from food waste. If food waste were a country, its greenhouse gas emissions would be the third largest in the world, following the US and China. 
                If we stopped throwing food away, we can save the equivalent of 17 metric tonnes of CO2, which can be the environmental equivalent of five cars off the roads in the UK. </p>

                <img src="https://u4d2z7k9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Untitled-design-2022-01-14T174016.208.jpg.webp"  alt="decription" style="width: 500px;" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px #888;">
            </div>
            <p class="sugu">3. Degradation of Land </p>
            <p class="gio">Our irresponsible use of food products has an adverse impact on the physical land itself. There are two ways in which we waste land. The land we use for producing the food, and the land we used for dumping the food.
                Agriculture uses 11.5million hectares of the global land surface. There are two types of land; “arable” land (that can grow crops), and “non-arable” land (that cannot grow crops). 900 million hectares of non-arable land is used for livestock to produce meat and dairy products. As meat is in higher demand, more arable landscapes are being converted into pastures for animals to graze. By doing so, we are gradually degrading our natural land in a way that prohibits anything natural from growing on it. 
                These statistics show that we are over-stressing land for food production and if we are not mindful in the future, the ability to yield will diminish overtime as we gradually degrade the land. Not only are we disrupting our beautiful, natural landscapes, but we are also harming the biodiversity present in nature, as converting arable land into pastures will cause a loss of habitat for animals and could also severely disrupt food chains in the ecosystem.</p>
            <p class="nio">4. Harm to Biodiversity </p>
            <p class="lio">Biodiversity simply refers to the different species and organisms that make up an environment’s ecosystem. 
                Agriculture in general causes harm to our biodiversity. Mono-cropping and converting our wild lands into pastures and suitable agricultural terrains is a common practice where there is an increase in demand for the production of livestock. 
                Deforestation and conversion of our natural lands into non-arable land destroys the natural flora and fauna present, and in some cases, to the point of their extinction. </p>

            <P class="cioo">Effective Solutions for Food Waste</P>
            <img class="sammy" src="https://u4d2z7k9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/48880596357_187f08253d_b.jpg.webp" alt="decription" style="width: 500px;" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px #0000ff;">
            <p class="mio">Food waste is one of the biggest environmental problems and challenges of our lifetime and it must be eradicated at all costs. However, some see it as a business opportunity ready for innovative solutions. If we properly educate ourselves about food waste, we would see that taking the steps to reduce it can be an excellent way to lower costs, generate profits, and alleviate climate change. Here are 11 effective solutions to tackle food waste for businesses, producers, retailers, and consumers. </p>
            <p class="pio">Creating Circular Food Systems</p>
            <p class="xio">The study was successful in that stakeholders were interested in collaboration at the end of the project. It also highlighted the importance of education and accessibility to landfill alternatives. Six solutions were developed from the collaboration in the project:
                <br>1. Measuring and tracking all food storage 
                Businesses were encouraged to use pre-existing food waste tracking technology. These systems can help make businesses aware of the money they are wasting on food waste that never gets to consumers. 
                
                <br>2. Creating a “Food Rescue” system
                This solution utilised a web-based system that matched locally available food to local food needs and volunteers to transfer the food to the ones that need it. 
                
                <br>3. Promoting statewide consumer and producer waste education
                Consumer education and awareness about the food system and the waste was encouraged. Doing so helped people see the true value of the food they are purchasing. There is a general lack of awareness, so implementing education programmes in schools can be an effective way to educate the public. 
                
                <br>4. Building of food handling and processing infrastructure
                This solution focuses on “upcycling” food that is already in the system, e.g. turning tomatoes into tomato sauce and increasing demand in canning and processing food for long-term storage. 
                The aim here is to connect key members of the food system and create synergy among handling and processing stakeholders. Primary issues to be addressed are transportation availability, storage limitations, and restrictions associated with food donation. 
                
                <br>5. Educate producers on the advantages of donating 
                This solution is also related to the second solution. The primary goal for this solution is to educate stakeholders on food donation incentives, legal protection, and offer guidance on relevant governmental agencies. 
                
                <br>6. Composting alternatives 
                This solution aims to increase available options for composting and other alternatives to disposal of food in landfills. Developing statewide practices to divert food waste from landfills can make huge cost savings possible. 
                </p>
            <p class="zio">Changing Food Crops</p>
            <p class="rio">The International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC)  recommends producers and farmers to consider a change in crops. They believe that improving food security and lowering greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved through changing what we eat, and growing more sustainable and hardy crops. These types of crops can be ones that are low maintenance, can cope with extreme weather events, and crops that can be interspersed with pastures and arable land.</p>
            <p class="pou">Redirecting Food Surplus and Educational Campaigns</p>
            <p class="xoi">Food waste from restaurants and business constitutes 28% of the food wasted. To rectify this, we can push for policies that limit waste and redirect uneaten food to places where it is needed. This can be in the form of food recovery programmes to direct surplus to shelters.
                There are other wide varieties of changes retailers can make in order to reduce their food waste. Some of these include upgrading their hardware with the latest technology, focusing on long-term sustainability rather than maximising returns from a product in the short-term, modifying their policies and regulations and ensuring all food is accepted to be sold etc.
                Supermarkets can also create campaigns, where they provide education, inspiration and advice to their customers. Sainsbury’s – the second largest chain of supermarkets in the UK – research found that people look to supermarkets for guidance on how to tackle food waste, therefore retailers could provide literature in the form of magazines and membership programmes, that can provide ideas on how customers can prevent food waste, as well as recipes on how to utilise leftover food.</p>
            <p class="voi">Rethink Our Food Perceptions and Habits</p>
            <img class="aio" src="https://u4d2z7k9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Untitled-design-2022-03-08T153357.132.jpg.webp" alt="decription" style="width: 500px;" style="padding-top:20px;" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px #888;">
            <p class="op">Food waste is also the responsibility of us as individuals, as food waste at home can amount to 37% of overall food waste. We need to change our habits in ways that significantly reduce the amount of food that we waste.
                One of the easiest solutions for food waste is through organisation methods. We could organise our fridge in a way that ensures the food that will go off first is clearly visible to us when we open the fridge. We could keep a list of the food we have bought on hand, and make a note of all the use-by labels. While this can be time consuming, a study in 2020 indicated that if you put these small efforts into reducing food waste, you could end up saving a substantial amount of money.
                We also need to change our minds and the way we perceive food. Rather than preparing and cooking a meal we are in the mood for, we should base our cooking decisions off of the food we see in the fridge that needs to be used first.</p>
            <div class="loyo">section 4</div>
            <p class="joyo">Technology and Innovation</p>
            <P class="zoo">Tomatoes rotting on vines because there is no one to pick them. Milk curdling in jars because there are no markets to bring it to. Fruits decaying on shelves because customers don’t have access to produce like before. Lost resources, wasted food. The restrictions in movement and quarantine measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the levels of food loss and waste the world over. 
                As the pandemic continues to put people’s food security and nutrition at risk in many countries and hurt the livelihoods of small producers, we are called to re-evaluate our food systems. 
                One thing is clear: in this time of crisis, there is no room for food loss and waste! 
                Fortunately, new and innovative technology is being developed every day to improve the way our food is produced, distributed and consumed, transforming our food systems for the better. Here are just a few examples: 
                1)    Apps to maximise the sale or donation of food
                Smartphones are increasingly widespread, and apps are a simple and easy way to reach large portions of the global population. During the pandemic, the popularity of apps to solve food loss and waste has increased. Several countries also began to develop apps to facilitate the logistics, transport and e-commerce of perishable foods. 
                Too Good to Go is one app that gives shops and restaurants in many cities a platform to sell their surplus food at reduced prices at the end of the day. For example, in Rome, app users can find food offered at discounted prices by a neighbourhood market, a large supermarket chain and popular city eateries. 
                The Feeding India app, instead, focuses on donations of food for those in need. Restaurants and individuals can sign up on the app to donate food, which is then collected and distributed by this non-profit’s network of more than 4 500 volunteers. These regular feeding programmes run in more than 45 Indian cities and have served over 4.8 million meals so far.
                In Kenya, the Twiga Foods platform connects 3 000 food outlets a day with fresh produce through a network of 17 000 farmers and 8 000 vendors, allowing restaurants to buy only what they need and farmers to deliver more efficiently. The company has reduced typical post-harvest losses in Kenya from 30 percent to 4 percent for produce brought to markets on the Twiga network</P>
            <img class="lolii" src="https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/medium/images/cover/medium_5b2cd2c7d07a36fb65d562471408e62a.jpg"    alt="decription" style="width: 500px;" style="padding-top:20px;" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px #888;"> 
            <p class="noo">2)  New technology through 3D product design</p>
            <p class="cop">FAO has worked on a number of innovative technologies to increase the efficiency of post-harvest handling and food processing. One of these new solutions harnesses 3D printing technology.  FAO offers online, open-source 3D designs of innovative equipment (equipment that the Organization itself uses in country projects) for download and use.
                One of FAO’s most popular downloads is a multipurpose wooden crate for the transport, handling, storage and retail display of produce, reducing the need for the produce to be transferred from one box to another. The innovative design uses basic wooden materials, but as a result much less food is ruined along the value chain. This design has had 13 000 downloads in under two years and is used widely in Sudan and Thailand.</p>
            <p class="lopy">3)    Simple equipment in an innovative way </p>
            <p class="ww">Being innovative is not all about new technology - it can also mean using simple techniques in a new way. Many FAO projects reduce food losses at the harvesting stage just by challenging traditional techniques and introducing new methods.
                For example, in many Asian countries a large proportion of produce is lost during transportation. One FAO project in three South Asian countries found that post-harvest losses ranged between 20 and 50 percent for fruits and vegetables. Much of this is due to packaging that fails to protect the produce. 
                In Bangladesh, tomatoes are traditionally transported from farm to market in large mesh sacks. Many of the tomatoes are bruised or damaged when they arrive. An FAO project in the region proposed using large crates instead, which substantially reduced losses and allowed farmers to sell a larger proportion of their produce. FAO provided groups of smallholder farmers with crates to get them started and trained them on food-handling best practices, including in transport. The difference in the quality and shelf-life of the produce was so noticeable that in Sri Lanka, one supermarket now provides crates to farmers to guarantee the quality of their produce. 
                Simple but effective changes like this can dramatically improve handling in the supply chain and have a huge impact on the income and food security of local farmers. They also contribute to improving the quality and shelf life food for consumers.</p>
            <img class="loliiy" src="https://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/medium/images/cover/medium_4429d7df1d51d04f2a5b7f70f57814ee.jpg"    alt="decription" style="width: 500px;" style="padding-top:20px;" style="box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px #888;"> 
            <p class="uu">29 September 2020 marked the first International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, and FAO called upon individuals, businesses and governments to act. This international day came in the middle of a global pandemic, one which has served to highlight the fragility of our current food systems and the importance of access and availability to food.
                For many people on the planet, food is a given. But for the millions of people who are chronically hungry, food is not a guarantee. Reducing loss and waste means respecting food and the natural resources, effort and investment that has gone into it. When we think about food’s backstory, it is easier to see what our food really represents and how precious it really is.</p>
            <p class="oo">Section 5</p>
            <p class="kk">How Individual can contribute</p>
            <p class="pp">Individuals play a crucial role in reducing food wastage and contributing to effective food management. Here are practical ways individuals can make a positive impact:

                <br>1. *Mindful Shopping:*
                   - Plan meals in advance and create a shopping list to avoid impulse buying.
                   - Purchase only what is needed and be mindful of expiration dates.
                
                <br>2. *Proper Storage:*
                   - Store perishable items properly to extend their freshness.
                   - Utilize a "first in, first out" approach to ensure older items are used before newer ones.
                
                <br>3. *Portion Control:*
                   - Serve and consume reasonable portions to minimize leftovers.
                   - Consider using smaller plates to help control portion sizes.
                
                <br>4. *Meal Planning:*
                   - Plan meals for the week to avoid overbuying and wasting ingredients.
                   - Get creative with leftovers to make new meals and reduce food disposal.
                
                <br>5. *Understanding Expiry Dates:*
                   - Understand the difference between "use by" and "best before" dates.
